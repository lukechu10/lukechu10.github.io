# Building an Arcade Cabinet - Design and Materials

This summer, I built an arcade cabinet from scratch.

This was my first wood working project. Since I had no idea what I was doing, or where to even get started, I found many blogs where others had built something similar to be great resources. Here are a few that were particularly helpful:

- [RetroMash](https://retromash.com/2015/01/02/building-a-home-arcade-machine-part-1/) - A great blog that walks you through every step of building a cabinet, from getting the materials to putting on the finishing touches.
- [DIY-arcade](https://github.com/maxvfischer/DIY-arcade) - Another great resource with step by step instructions. Also includes CAD files! This served as a great reference when designing my own cabinet.
- [Slagcoin](https://www.slagcoin.com/joystick/layout.html) - Basically the bible of arcade control panel layouts.

And many more which I have forgotten to include.

## CAD Design

The first step in building an arcade cabinet is designing it. There are plenty of pre-made cabinet plans out there already, many which are available for free. In fact, [this website](https://www.classicarcadecabinets.com/arcade-plans-by-title.html) contains a giant list of plans for all the original cabinets of many different arcade games.

However, I was feeling ambitious and so I wanted to build a completely custom arcade cabinet from scratch. There are many ways of designing your cabinet from scratch. Popular options seem to be [SketchUp](https://www.sketchup.com) and [Autodesk Fusion](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview). Of course, drawing all the plans out on paper is also a possible option. But I wanted to play around with the fancy tools so I opted for CAD instead. I had used SketchUp before for a different project but wasn't particularly a big fan so I decided to try out Fusion. I also had free access to an educational license which was convenient, since the price of an Autodesk license can be quite steep.

It took me a little over a week of fiddling around, a lot of it spent learning the software, the come up with a complete design of my cabinet. Overall, the process was not too painful and I learned a lot about CAD modeling.
